              <p> The business organizations with which I am familiar are advocate offices located near the Davis college campus and educational institutions,
                where the following proposal may be found.

                                      <h6 style ="color:green"> THE NETWORK TOPOLOGY </h6>
  
                The network structure or shape used in Advocates offices is bus topology, in which all devices in the network are connected to a single line or cable.
                The nodes are directly linked by a common half-duplex link known as the bus. Station refers to a bus host. Every station in a bus network receives all
                network traffic,and traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority.Image for bus topology For Educational institutions such as here
                in Davis college-Akilah, hybrid topology is used, One that combines two or more different topologies to form a new topology. This combination of topologies 
                is determined by the needs of the organization. For example, if one office department has ring topology and another has bus topology, connecting the two will
                result in Hybrid topology.
                Figure: showing hybrid structure.

                                        <h7style ="color:green"> TYPE OF NETWORK</h7>
  
                The type of network used by the advocate office and other many businesses including the Davis college campus, the first internet they use will be limited to
                a separate building. This type of network is known as a local area network (LAN). A LAN is a computer network made up of access points, cables, routers,
                and switches that allow users to share to servers and inbuilt servers inside a single block,  community college, or home network, as well as to other networks.
                There are two types of LAN peer-to-peer networks. (In its most basic form, a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is formed when two or more PCs connect and share 
                resources without the use of a separate server computer),as well as client/server (Typically, a client computer communicates only with servers and not with other 
                clients. A client system is a standard PC that runs an operating system such as Windows Current operating systems include client software that allows client computers to 
                access the resources that servers share). The LAN network is used to connect computers and devices within small areas such as several floors in the building.

                                   <h8style ="color:green">DEVICES THEY WILL NEED</h8>
  
               Business printers, photocopiers, and scanners are required, as well as an internet connection and a Network interface card (NIC) or wireless network interface 
               controller (WNIC) as a transmission medium. They also require a hub, switch, wireless access point (for these organizations that use AP, a networking hardware
               device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network). a router, a gateway (a piece of networking hardware or software used in telecommunications
               for telecommunications networks that allows data to flow from one discrete network to another), and a bridge. Network interface card (NIC): a piece of computer 
               hardware that connects a computer to a computer network. Wireless network interface controller (WNIC): is a network interface controller that connects to
               a wireless network like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth rather than a wired network like Token Ring or Ethernet. They communicate via microwaves using an antenna,
               which is typically connected to the computer's PCI bus or USB port.
  
                                  <h9style ="color:gren">TRANSIMISSION TECHNOLOGY<h9> 
                                    
               WI-FI or ethernet transmission can be used in offices to connect computers and devices in a network. A typical WI-FI LAN runs one or more wireless access points
               to which devices in the average area are connected. Ethernet allows devices to communicate with one another through the use of security rules, 
               which is a set of rules or a common network language.Ethernet specifies how network devices format and transmit data so that other devices on the same
               LAN can recognize, receive, and process it. Ethernet cable is the physical, encased wiring that transmits data. I recommend Ethernet as it is most likely used by
               connected devices that use cables to access a geographically localized network rather than a wireless connection When compared Ethernet is less susceptible 
               to disruptions. Because devices must connect via physical cabling, it can also provide a higher level of network security and control than wireless technology.
